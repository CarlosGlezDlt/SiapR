# SiapR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SiapR is to provide an easy way to extract and gather
the agricultural and cattle information from siap since 1980 until
the last release. For that porpuse are built two funcions:
extract_a() for agricultural data and 
extract_g() for cattle data

## Installation

You can install the development version of SiapR like so:

``` r
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github(repo = "CarlosGlezDlt/SiapR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(SiapR)
agriculture_dataframe <- extract_a()
cattle_dataframe <- extract_g()
```
